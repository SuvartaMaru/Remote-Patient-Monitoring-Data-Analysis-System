                                  -- 'Remote Patient Monitoring' --


-- What is RPM : Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) refers to the use of digital technologies to collect health 
-- data from individuals in one location (often their home) and electronically transmit that information securely to healthcare providers 
-- in a different location for assessment and recommendations.

-- How It Works:
-- 1) Patients use devices like blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, pulse oximeters, and wearables 
-- (like smartwatches) that automatically collect health metrics.
-- 2) Data is transmitted in real-time or at scheduled intervals to healthcare providers via mobile apps, cloud platforms, 
-- or integrated health systems.

-- Apprised by client : 

-- The client does not receive payment if the patient fails to monitor for more than 7 days. 
-- Therefore, it is important to send timely reminders to patients to ensure consistent monitoring.
-- The client is responsible for a $100 charge for each device that is either lost or not used by the patient for monitoring.
-- The acceptable range for Heart Rate (HR) is between 45 and 90 beats per minute.
-- The threshold for SPO2 (oxygen saturation) is below 90%.
-- The client would like to identify which disease has the highest number of patient visits.
-- The client is interested in determining the specific age group of patients experiencing the most issues with both SPO2 and HR.
-- The client wants to analyze which gender is more affected and understand the percentage difference between the two.

# **PROJECT: Remote Patient Monitoring – Data Analysis System**

### **Domain:** Healthcare Analytics

## **Project Background**

A healthcare provider uses **Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)** devices to track patients’ vitals (Heart Rate & SPO2) daily.
The main challenge was:

| Problem                        | Impact                  |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Patients missing monitoring    | Company not paid        |
| Device not returned            | Financial loss          |
| No real-time health alerts     | Emergency risk          |
| No age-gender disease patterns | Poor treatment planning |

The goal of this project was:
➡ Improve patient monitoring consistency
➡ Identify high-risk patients
➡ Reduce device loss cost
➡ Provide insights to doctors
➡ Understand disease & demographic impact

-- Key Insights : 
-- 1) The max patients fall under age 40 to 70 and in specific in between age 50 to 60 from the dataset pdf.
-- 2) The max patients fall under age 50 to 70 and in specific in between age 50 to 60 for low SPO2. 
-- 3) The max patients fall under age 40 to 70 and in specific in between age 60 to 70 for out of limit HR.
-- 4) The max patients fall under age 40 to 70 and in specific in between age 50 to 60 for low SPO2 and out of limit HR.
-- 5) The low SPO2 and out of limit HR for female is 25% more then male.
-- 6) The Interstitial Lung Disease having least number of patient and Pulmonary Fibrosis having major number of patients.
-- 7) The disease like Asthma, Central Sleep Apnea, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Cystic Fibrosis having high number of patients 
-- who's SPO2 and HR is unstable but highest number of patients are follow under Pulmonary Fibrosis.
-- 13) There are total 168 patients who doesn't monitored since last two months and they required reminders or return of the device. 
-- 14) There are total 12 patients who doesn't monitored since a year and they required return of the device.
-- 15) There are total 239 patients who enrolled in last 15 days and these patients need introduction call of the program so, 
-- that they will be consistent. 
-- 16) There are 350 patients who's RPM consent is false and these patients needs to get archive from the program 
-- becasue they are already opted out.
-- 17) There are 206 patients who monitored less then 7 days between 30-04-2025 and 18-05-2025 and there patient needs 
-- consistent reminders for monitoring.

## Business Outcomes

✔ Reduced risk by **identifying 27 critical patients with both HR & SPO2 unstable**
✔ Prevented device loss by **tracking 168 patients inactive for 60+ days**
✔ Identified **Pulmonary Fibrosis as highest impacting disease**
✔ Gender analysis: Female affected **25% more than male**
✔ Can Build **Power BI dashboard** for decision making
